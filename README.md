# 1 Personal Studies

## 1.1 Intro 

This is my personal diary in Web Development Studies. Here I will put my notes/summaries, and codes in the process of learning, and maybe some dates too, to remember when I started some points. I'm a very deep-learning person ( :walking: ), so please don't criticize me for my dates. I know that 2 months to learn CSS is too much time ( :eyes: :eyes: :eyes: ), but it's my personal time, and I think that each one has yours ( :clock7: ).

## 1.3 Main Schedule

Here I'm put the main thought that I had to start my journey:

- Frontend Start (CodeCademy, Roadmap, FreeCodeCamp, etc.)
  - The Power Trio (yes I took this name from metal music): HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
  - React, Node, Next;
  - Three-tier architecture;
  - Deploy;
- Backend Start (CodeCademy, Roadmap, FreeCodeCamp, etc.)
- In some way, create personal projects and enhance the skills that I aim to learn in the steps before
- Certainly, I will see other skills that I have to learn. But I will keep this to the uncertain future
