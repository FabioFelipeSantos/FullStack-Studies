# 1. GOALS

In this project, I will be building my own basic design system for a website. In essence, I will be building a website to help me build MORE websites in the future!

- [ ] **Color Section**
  - [ ] A name
  - [ ] A box displaying the color itself.
  - [ ] The CSS value used to create the color (in `hex`, `rgb()` or `hsl()`).
  - [ ] An optional description of how you intend to use the colors.
- [ ] **Fonts Section**
  - [ ] The font name.
  - [ ] A series of styles that you intend to use (plain, bold and italic, underlined).
  - [ ] Demonstrate the text style. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
- [ ] **Text Styles for Page Elements**
  - [ ] A page element name (for example, “Subheading”).
  - [ ] All style rules (font-weight: 700).

## 1.1. Main objective

On my site, I will collect all the _colors_, _fonts_, and some of the _repeating styles_.

## 1.2. Instructions

- Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.
- Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas as you’d like.
- [Example of website Style Guide](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/website-design-system/example/index.html?_gl=1*rh6sqr*_ga*MzA2NDYwNzAyNC4xNzA4NTE5NzA5*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcxMzQzNDAxNi4xMDEuMS4xNzEzNDM2MDAxLjUyLjAuMA..)

## Color Section

The style guide should include a labeled section outlining the colors to be used.

Each color should have:

- A name (you can come up with this name yourself)
- A box displaying the color itself.
- The CSS value used to create the color (in `hex`, `rgb()` or `hsl()`).
- An optional description of how you intend to use the colors.

## Fonts Section

The style should include a labeled section of the fonts to be used. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

I should include the following for every font:

- The font name.
- A series of styles that you intend to use (for example, styles could include: plain, bold and italic, underlined).
- For each style, include a sentence or series of words to demonstrate the text style. Use " **The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog** ".

## Text Styles for Page Elements

I should include a section for specific text styles for page elements. I have to make sure to include at least 3 element styles.

For each page element, include:

- A page element name (for example, “Subheading”).
- All style rules (for example, font-weight: 700).
