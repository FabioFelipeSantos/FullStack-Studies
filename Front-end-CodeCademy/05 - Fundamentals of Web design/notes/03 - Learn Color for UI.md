# 1 Master Review

- Select a dominant brand color and supporting accent colors
- Pay attention on how to show states of buttons (mainly hovered and disabled) and for forms (submitted, missing info, not sent, )
- Use contrast to define sections and differentiate actions
- Use semantic colors for error (red), success (green), and warning (yellow) messages
- Incorporate default colors for text and backgrounds where needed
- Neutral colors can provide good contrast
- Use sites that help you achieve accessibility: [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Keep users in mind when selecting color

## 1.1 Contrast Constraints

- Contrast is a great way to differentiate elements on a page. However, by doing so to all elements, it can cause a cognitive overload for users.
- It’s important to limit the overall amount of contrast. This helps you to highlight only the most important parts of the page—the actions.
- Having a neutral background (any color with low lightness or saturation) is a good base, because it allows you to add high contrast to the parts of the site where you want to direct a user’s attention.
- Similarly, a dark background with light colored text can be a reasonable alternative.

## 1.2 Brand Color

- It's important to have a brand color defined.
- There’s a site called [BrandColors](https://brandcolors.net/) dedicated to showing brand's colors for various companies.
- It’s essential to select and apply a hue that should dominate your color palette. This brand color will account for roughly 60% of the color used on your site.

## 1.3 Accent Colors

- Accent colors are hues that will provide small pops (pequenos detalhes) of color, mainly used to draw the user’s attention.
- For instance, if you’ve selected a color scheme, one (or more) of the colors from your palette would be used as an accent color. This would allow you to apply these accent colors in various parts of your design to help the user decipher calls-to-action, which are an important part of guiding the user to achieve their goal.

## 1.4 Buttons

- Buttons are one type of element where accent colors can be used effectively. The color of a button can determine a lot in the user’s eyes.
- There are different states a button has as the user interacts with them. Two common states used are the **hover state ** and the ** disabled state**.
- The hover state typically features a *shade or tint of the accent color* used for the buttons.
- The disabled state implies that the button cannot be clicked, either because it’s not an active button or the user must complete steps prior to the button activating.

## 1.5 Forms

- There is the **default state**, which is how the user views the inputs when they first arrive at a page.
- The second state is the selected, or active, state. These provide the user with a visual cue that they have highlighted the field and have the ability to type within it. This is typically achieved by using a border color or a box shadow effect.
- If the input field is unable to be edited or typed within, there should be a disabled state as well. This should render much like the disabled button, in that it is grayed out.
- Maybe add some of semantic colors (red - error/failure, green - success/sent, yellow - attention/directions, blue - info/steps).

## 1.6 Semantic Colors

- You have to remember to provide additional indications to the user when something goes right or wrong.
- Errors will arise and when this happens, users should be alerted to understand where they went wrong.
- Red can be a color for showing errors and can also be used to provide more emphasis for delete content buttons.
- When a user achieves their goal, a good way to show success is through the use of green. Green is also often used for actions that entice the user to submit, move forward, or go.
- If an error occurs on the website and we need to notify the user, we should consider selecting the yellow color.
- The visual feedback you provide users with when they interact with your interface is incredibly important. It can help alleviate pain points some users might experience.

## 1.7 Default Colors

- Almost every site you design will incorporate black, white, and shades of gray in some way. These default colors are used often as the color for text within your designs.
- When selecting the color of your text, it’s important to ensure the contrast is high enough for the text to be legible. However, too much contrast can also be an issue.
- Pure black on white can be hard on the user’s eyes because of the stark contrast. Using a darker gray for text on a white background, or white text on a dark gray background, helps soften the feel while still providing clear enough contrast to be legible without issue.

## 1.8 Neutral Colors

- Neutral colors, or hues with *low lightness and/or saturation*, make for good base colors as it **allows you to add flourishes** to the parts of the site where you want to direct the user’s attention.
- For example, similar to using a dark gray with white text, you can use a darker shade of a color with light colored text. Using a medium shade or tint of a color can be difficult to achieve the same result, as the contrast is lower.

## 1.9 Whitespace

- Space is an important aspect of creating balanced and harmonious layouts in web design.
- Whitespace, or negative space, refers to the emptiness between elements. It’s not necessarily white in color, even though, that is sometimes the case.
- For example, you will notice that [Google](http://www.google.com/) embraces whitespace on its landing page. It focuses the user’s attention solely on the primary action, which is searching for content.
- Too much whitespace can negatively impact the flow of your site. By including too much spacing in-between elements, it can cause issues for users trying to navigate seamlessly through the content.

## 1.10 Accessibility

- Making sure that the colors you choose for your UI components are accessible is a really important aspect of visual design.
- Using contrasting colors will help users that need assistance understand and differentiate the content you have designed.
- However, many users can experience different types of color blindness:
	- **red-green**, where users have a difficult time differentiating between the red and green colors.
	- **blue-yellow**, where the blues tend to appear greener
	- **monochromatic**, when users can’t see color at all.
- To make your sites more accessible, try pairing another indicator along with color to convey information.
- If you are having trouble deciding on an accessible color palette you can visit [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) which creates accessible color palettes for your site or app based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
- Already decided on colors? You can go to [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to test how your selected colors work with web usability.

## 1.11 Iterations

- Testing and iteration are essential parts of the user-centered design process. Test early and test often is the motto (o lema) of designers!
- As some users are different from others, gaining a better understanding of who you are building for will help in ensuring the color choices work.
