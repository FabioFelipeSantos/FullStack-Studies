# 1 The Color Wheel

- Is a tool used by artists and designers to visualize the relationship between colors.
- Primary colors are comprised of red, blue and yellow. Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors, forming green, orange and purple. Tertiary colors are formed when mixing a secondary and primary.

# 2 The Color Wheel and HSLA

- HSLA is the most semantic system of setting colors with CSS.
- **Hue** - is the “pure” color that is expressed as the angle in degrees around the color wheel.
- **Saturation** - intensity or purity of that hue.
	- 100% is the color itself
	- 0% are completely grayscale.
- Lightness refers to the lightness of the color.
	- 0% is black
	- 100% is white.
- A, or alpha, refers to the opacity.
	- 0% is fully transparent
	- 100% is fully opaque.

# 3 Warm Colors

- Warm colors range between red and yellow, which include various versions of those colors in addition to orange. This also comprises colors such as brown and tan. <div style="margin: auto; display: inline-block; background-color: #D2B48C; width: 200px; height: 30px; color: black; font-size: 20px;">Tan</div>
- Warm colors can also promote a feeling of aggression and are considered bold.

# 4 Cool Colors

- The cool colors are on the other side of the color wheel in contrast to warm colors
- They range between blue, purple and green. Most gray colors fall into the cool category as well.
- Cool colors are calming, soothing nature. They’re often associated with winter climates or water.

# 5 Tints and Shades

- Tints (matiz) occur when white is applied to a color, adding or increasing the lightness of a hue.
- Shades are created when black is added to a color, which decreases the lightness of a hue.
- In HSLA the lightning starts at 0% (black) and ranges to 100% (white).

# 6 Color Contrast

- Colors ***opposite*** of each other on the color wheel tend to have a **higher contrast**. Colors that fall next to each other have a lower contrast to one another.
- It’s vital to ensure contrast levels provide clarity to the users. Also is essential to increase the contrast of designs in order to promote ease of use and legibility.
- The high contrast between the two colors provides the best ability for users to read the information without any difficulty.

# 7 Color Schemes

- The color wheel comes in handy when deciding which colors might fit with one another, and using it can allow you to create a variety of color schemes.
- Color schemes (or color palettes) are the result of pairing two or more colors together. The colors you select can make or break your design, however, knowing your options will put you in a better place to determine what is best for moving forward.
- When deciding which colors to use in your design, there are four different color schemes to consider:
	- Monochromatic
	- Complementary
	- Analogous
	- Triadic

## 7.1 Monochromatic Designs

- The most basic color scheme possible utilizes a single color with varying shades and tints to create a monochromatic palette.

- This can help you to eliminate the monotonous feeling with high contrast. It’s important to select a much lighter and much darker shade of the main color.
- The use of a single color can provide an immediate sense of harmony.

# 8 Complementary Designs

- If you were to select blue as your main color, it would create maximum contrast and intensity with orange.
![[complementary.png||400]]

- Complementary schemes provide a dramatic display of color, which can be applied to websites as well.
- Complementary color schemes are popular on the web as they have high contrast in the color pairing. They can draw attention to certain elements on the page that you want users to focus on.

### 8.1.1 Analogous Color Schemes

Analogous color schemes apply three or more colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. Typically, there is one dominant color (or hue), combined with a second to support, and a third to accent the color palette.

- Analogous color schemes create a visually pleasing and calming display. However, analogous color schemes provide a low-contrast experience.
- They shouldn’t be used for content that needs the user’s direct attention, but they can be used to create backgrounds that do not compete with the main content of the site.

# 9 Triadic Color Schemes

- Triadic color schemes, much like complementary schemes, provide additional pops of color while allowing for some flexibility in the range you can use.
- These consist of three colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel.

- Triadic color schemes are useful in that they create a sense of equality, vibrancy, and security in your designs.
