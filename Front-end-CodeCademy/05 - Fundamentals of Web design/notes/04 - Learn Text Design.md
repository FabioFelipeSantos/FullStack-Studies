# 1 Differentiating Text: HTML Headers

- No user will read every sentence on your website. My job is to make sure that the user reads all important texts.
- You can guide a user through your site by creating contrast with headings, subheading, and lists (ordered or unordered).
- As a best practice, the following HTML elements are used to differentiate text into categories:
	- `<h1>` — Used for titles. You should only have one header this style per page.
	- `<h2>` — Used for headings. This should be to identify major sections you want the user to immediately be drawn towards.
	- `<h3>` — Used for subheadings. This should be used for smaller focal points, such as articles, that you want the user to notice when scanning the page.
- Use HTML tags to remind yourself to be concise, and break things into lists and headings whenever possible.
- Make sure that headings are closer to the content that they are introducing than the content that they come after. They do not provide clear visual organization if they are equidistant from both settings.

# 2 Differentiating Text: Fonts

- It is effective to have a different font for a page title, and perhaps a third font for certain sub-headers. 
- It often works well to have most of your text in a sans-serif font, and then create contrast with headings or subheadings in a serif font.
- In addition to fonts and headers, you can contrast between different pieces of text in a number of ways:
	- style
	- size
	- weight
	- color

# 3 Whitespace

- Without proper spacing and balance, your text can be rendered virtually illegible.
- A website is like a room, the user needs to be able to move through it easily. And just like a room, it is important to keep it tidy and free of clutter. This is the power of whitespace. Good whitespace allows you to increase the legibility of your text, helps prevent users from skimming over elements, and serves as an unintrusive boundary between different sections of the page, without actually being there.

It’s just like standing in line at the store. You don’t want to be breathing down the neck of the person in front of you, it’s not comfortable for anyone! It’s the same with text, you don’t want your title crowded out by your subheaders, and you don’t want that paragraph invading the personal space of the nearby image.
