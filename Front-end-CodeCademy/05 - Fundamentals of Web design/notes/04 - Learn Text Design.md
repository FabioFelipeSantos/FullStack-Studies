- In general, users may not spend a lot of time on websites, so we can utilize certain layout and spacing techniques to guide their experience. Studies have shown that the users read in an *“F” Pattern*, starting at the top and then scanning along the spine. Designers can take advantage of this behavior and craft their designs to mimic this practice.
- The average internet paragraph is only 1-3 sentences.
- People will notice and remember the first and last elements of a list or a page better than anything in the middle of the list/page. This is known as **Primacy and Recency** effects.


# 2 Differentiating Text: HTML Headers

- No user will read every sentence on your website. My job is to make sure that the user reads all important texts.
- You can guide a user through your site by creating contrast with headings, subheading, and lists (ordered or unordered).
- As a best practice, the following HTML elements are used to differentiate text into categories:
	- `<h1>` — Used for titles. You should only have one header this style per page.
	- `<h2>` — Used for headings. This should be to identify major sections you want the user to immediately be drawn towards.
	- `<h3>` — Used for subheadings. This should be used for smaller focal points, such as articles, that you want the user to notice when scanning the page.
- Use HTML tags to remind yourself to be concise, and break things into lists and headings whenever possible.
- Make sure that headings are closer to the content that they are introducing than the content that they come after. They do not provide clear visual organization if they are equidistant from both settings.

# 3 Differentiating Text: Fonts

- It is effective to have a different font for a page title, and perhaps a third font for certain sub-headers. 
- It often works well to have most of your text in a sans-serif font, and then create contrast with headings or subheadings in a serif font.
- In addition to fonts and headers, you can contrast between different pieces of text in a number of ways:
	- style
	- size
	- weight
	- color

# 4 Whitespace

- Without proper spacing and balance, your text can be rendered virtually illegible.
- Good whitespace allows you to increase the legibility of your text, helps prevent users from skimming over elements, and serves as an unintrusive boundary between different sections of the page, without actually being there.
- You have to guarantee that the section title won't be crowded out by your sub-headers, and you won't want a paragraph to invade the personal space of a nearby image. 

# 5 Text Readability

- To guarantee a pleasant experience for users to read the text on your website, here are some tips to accomplish this:
	- Make sure that your text *is big enough (over 16px)*.
	- Have a strong contrast between the foreground and the background.
	- Make sure there is enough space between lines and letters (remember, whitespace is king!)  

## 5.1 Line Spacing

- Line spacing, also known as _Leading_, refers to the distance between two lines of text. Adjusting this value has a huge impact on the legibility of your site.

## 5.2 Tracking

- It's a way to make your text more readable by adjusting the space between the letters **and** the words.

## 5.3 Kerning

- _Kerning_ is the space between two letters in the text. You typically will not need to worry about kerning because a well-designed typeface already has optimal kerning built in.

# 6 Text Navigability

- To guarantee to a user a perfect navigation, we should be clear what they can click, and where it will take them.
	- Stick to conventions about showing what is clickable (generally, links should be blue and underlined). Underlining links is less common now than a few years ago. It’s optional, but a nice courtesy to colorblind users.
	- Never use blue as a general accent color for text, because your users will probably try to click on it no matter what.
	- Having text on navigation buttons is important. It removes all uncertainty about what each button does.  
- Sticking to these simple rules will allow users to easily navigate your page and makes them more likely to stick around and experience the actual content of your site.
- If you organize the text into columns, the user’s eyes will likely not travel across the entire screen, they will travel to the end of a column and then down. 
- Similarly, if you have long line lengths, the user’s eyes will spend more time traveling from left to right. We’ll cover this further in the next exercise.
