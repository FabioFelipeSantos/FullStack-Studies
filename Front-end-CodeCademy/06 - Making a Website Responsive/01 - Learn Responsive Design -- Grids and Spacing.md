# 1 Summary

- _Grids_ are made up of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines.
- _Grid systems_ help you organize your designs and provide a series of guidelines to properly align elements on a page.
- The *column grid* breaks up a page into vertical units that span the width of the content, and this grid structure can dictate how elements are laid out with precision and elegance.
- the grid comprises three major components:
	- **Columns** are defined as the vertical sections that span the width of a page. (12 - 16 is the usual)
	- A **Gutter** is the negative space between each column.
	- **Margins** appear on the left and right sides of the column-based grid. These ensure the content of your designs doesn’t match up to the edges of the browser window.

-  Within a *grid*, content can span multiple **columns**. **Columns** are separated by **gutters**.
- _Rows_ are the horizontal lines on a grid. Think of rows as invisible boxes that group content together by height. Rows are commonly used in web designs to **group content together** and re-order other content to allow for more whitespace.
- A row can be used to force content away from an area that has remaining columns not used.

- In the first row, the logo, the gutter, and the navigation bar span the entirety of the first row. Therefore, the next element must go in the second row.
- _Gutters_ make up the negative space between columns. There isn't a rule for the width of a gutter, but we have to make sure that he is big enough that two consecutive elements won't be confused and that he is smaller than the column width.
- _Responsive design_ is a set of techniques that allow a website’s content to shift based on the device or screen size. It can require a different number of total columns based on screen size, in order to accommodate content and keep it from being squished.
- _Whitespace_, or negative space, refers to the emptiness between elements, whether that’s in the gutter of the columns, or additional padding around a block of text.
- Whitespace is broken up into *Passive* and *Active*:
	- **Passive** - Used to improve the aesthetics of the layout without guiding the user through a specific reading, flow, or content order. Can be controlled by altering CSS properties such as `line-height` or `margin` when setting type.
	- **Active** - Refers to enhancing the overall page structure through space to emphasize content or guide users from one point to the next.  It is mainly achieved by adding space between a site’s elements.
