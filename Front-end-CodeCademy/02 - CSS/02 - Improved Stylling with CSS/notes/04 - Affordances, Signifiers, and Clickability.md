# 1 Introduction

**Clickability**
For users on the web, the mouse click is perhaps the most fundamental human-computer interaction. The web _became_ the web partially through the power of _hypertext_, or text in one document that links to other documents or resources. To this day, users navigate the web largely through mouse clicks (and finger taps on mobile and tablet devices).

**Affordances** (recursos, dispor, disponibilidade)
Objects _afford_ the ability of users to interact with them in various ways. For instance, a bench affords a person the ability to sit on it, but if it is not affixed to the ground, it also affords the user the ability to turn it over, throw (if the user is physically able), or perform any number of other actions. Even though the designer was probably not designing the bench with throwing in mind as the primary user behavior, the object still affords this action. Potentials for interaction are collectively called the _affordances_ of an object.

**Signifiers**
_Signifiers_ are aspects of an object that a designer uses to indicate potential and intended affordances of an object. For example, a teacup with no handle affords the ability to lift it and drink out of it. But designers and potters often add handles to _signify_ that users can and should lift up the object and take a sip. The handle is an example of a common _user experience pattern_.

# 2 UX Patterns

User experience (UX) patterns establish reusable solutions to common problems. Handles are ubiquitous—they are used on objects of all shapes, sizes, and purposes to indicate that users can initiate an action by grabbing the handle with their hand(s).

# 3 Affordances and Signifiers in Web Design

- The possible affordances of any computer are usually relatively limited;
- So, using proper signifiers is especially important to direct users properly;
- We could also use signifiers to demonstrate elements that afford interaction;
- Signifiers signify critical information, even if the signifier itself is an accidental byproduct of the world;
- Signifiers will often be useful, but of mixed reliability;
